I’m a passionate software developer with a strong focus on web technologies.

Currently, I’m studying at a University, building on the foundation I gained as a student at the [HTL Leonding](https://www.htl-leonding.at/).

Professionally, I work as a software developer. Before this, I honed my DevOps/IT skills at the company [Bluesource](https://www.bluesource.at/en/) and worked at multiple internships for school.

Beyond my work and studies, I currently love diving into the world of NixOS. When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me experimenting with new tech or refining my workflows.
